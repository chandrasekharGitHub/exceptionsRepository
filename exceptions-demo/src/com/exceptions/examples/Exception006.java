/*
 * 
 * The finally block always executes immediately after try-catch 
 * block exits.
 * 
 * The finally block is executed in case even if an unexpected exception 
 * occurs.
 * 
 * The main usage of finally block is to do clean up job (code). 
 * 
 * Keeping cleanup code in a finally block is always a good practice, 
 * even when no exceptions are occurred.
 * 
 * The runtime system always executes the code within the finally block 
 * regardless of what happens in the try block. 
 * 
 * So it is the ideal place to keep cleanup code.
